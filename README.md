# 💧 Water Supply Tracker using Graphs

This project simulates a **Water Supply Tracking System** using **Graph Algorithms** in C++. It models a water distribution network where **stations** like sources, tanks, and houses are connected via **pipes**, and helps track, traverse, and optimize the flow of water using BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra’s algorithm.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔗 Add and manage water stations and pipeline connections
- 🔍 Traverse the network using:
  - **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**
  - **DFS (Depth-First Search)**
- 📏 Find the most cost-effective path using **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**
- 💻 Written in simple and clean **C++** – beginner-friendly and easy to understand
- 🧠 Helps simulate real-world infrastructure problems using Data Structures

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

### 1. BFS (Breadth-First Search)
- Explores the network level by level.
- Simulates how water spreads from a source to nearby stations.

### 2. DFS (Depth-First Search)
- Explores deeper paths from a source.
- Helps trace isolated or deep branches of the network.

### 3. Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- Finds the **shortest path** from the main source to all other stations.
- Optimizes the cost and length of pipeline connections.
